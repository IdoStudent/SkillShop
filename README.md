## Introduction

SkillShop is a web-based job matchmaking application. The idea behind SkillShop comes from the notion that businesses looking for candidates generally take a more passive role in the process, and much of the burden is on the Jobseeker. SkillShop aims to reverse this, placing the responsibility in the hands of the business to actively seek out candidates that would be right for them. 

## How SkillShop was Built

SkillShop was built using Reactjs and a serverless AWS Stack. More detailed information can be read in the Technical Solution Document.

SkillShop also utilised several public Reactjs packages. Credits to;

- tabler-react
- Semantic UI React
- react-dropzone-uploader


## Getting Started Locally

The production version of SkillShop is available at <https://skillshop.app>, however, a local version can easily be run on any computer.

Firstly, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed. It is always recommended to have these updated to the latest version. 

To set up a local copy;
1. Clone this repository 
2. In the react-app folder, run `yarn install`. This will install all the required dependencies and packages.
3. When the installation has finished, run `yarn start`. This will host the project locally and should automatically open a browser window that takes you to the project. If not, typing localhost:3000 in your address bar should take you to the application.
